# ToDo's

- write an article how to switch back to nautilus in Gnome (if you have installed XFCE parallely) -- exo-preffered-applications
- virtualbox modules not loaded after kernel upgrade `VBoxManage --version` -> `dpkg-reconfigure virtualbox-dkms`

```
VBoxManage --version                                                                                                                                               (no jobs) [master] â–¼ Week 48 28.11.14 10:30
    WARNING: The character device /dev/vboxdrv does not exist.
    Please install the virtualbox-dkms package and the appropriate
    headers, most likely linux-headers-generic.

    You will not be able to start VMs until this problem is fixed.
