- [what every CS major should know](http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/) At least what the author thinks what everyone should know. Nonetheless, an interesting list of links and topics

## PDFs

- [What every programmer should know about floating point](https://www.ualberta.ca/~kbeach/phys420_580_2010/docs/ACM-Goldberg.pdf) Never heard of IEEE754 or didn't know what a mantissa is? Read this!
- [what every programmer should know about memory](https://people.freebsd.org/~lstewart/articles/cpumemory.pdf). This article (or short book) is well written and refreshes or explains a lot of concepts that are worth to know about computer memory. This is *not* solely written for system programmers!

## Math

- [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/) A graphical online calculator. Regarding this as calculator is a bit too much understatement. This is really great to make interactive function plots

- [diyaudio.com](http://www.diyaudio.com/) Maybe the largest online resource for DIY audio enthusiasts (except software)
