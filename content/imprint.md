The best way to get in touch with me is via email: <code class="imprint-email">ten.tgnilk@znila</code>.

I also have to provide my postal address because every website that is constantly updated is regarded as *commercial* in german law and therefore needs to show it in the imprint. Otherwise any ~~dickhead~~ lawyer could admonish you because of some laws in the [Telemediengesetz](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemediengesetz) (which was created by a bunch of ~~apes~~ clever people).

I disagree to the usage and transmission of data used for the purpose of
advertisment- market or opinion research.

This website **doesn't** use any tracker or analysis tools like [Google
Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/), but I do keep the server logs for about 10 days to get some statistics out of it. If you notice anything suspicious please let me know.

PGP

I care about privacy and so should you. You can get my GPG public key from a [key-server](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xA57EA37073871146) like this: `gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu/ --recv-keys 0x73871146`. Feel free to send me encrypted emails.
