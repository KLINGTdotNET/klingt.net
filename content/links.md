- [what every CS major should know](http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/) At least what the author thinks what everyone should know. Nonetheless, an interesting list of links and topics

- [what every programmer should know about memory](https://people.freebsd.org/~lstewart/articles/cpumemory.pdf). This article (or short book) is well written and refreshes or explains a lot of concepts that are worth to know about computer memory. This is *not* solely written for system programmers!
