Sometimes my laptop can't connect to the wifi network after waking up
from suspend. Furthermore the network icons are missing from Gnomes
panel. Simply restarting the `NetworkManager.service` via `systemctl`
doesn't help in most cases, but the following works for me:

```bash
sudo systemctl kill NetworkManager.service wpa_supplicant.service
sudo systemctl start NetworkManager.service wpa_supplicant.service
```
