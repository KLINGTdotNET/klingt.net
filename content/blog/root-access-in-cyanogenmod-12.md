I've wondered why
[SuperSU](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.supersu&hl=de)
wasn't working after I've [upgraded my phone to
CM12](/posts/installing-cyanogenmod-12-android-l-on-htc-one-s-ville/)
yesterday. To enable root access you have to activate the *Developer
Menu* by touching 7 times on the *Build Number* in *Settings â†’ About
Phone/Tablet*. Now you can enable it only for Apps, the Android Debug
Bridge or both in the developer menu.

I' not sure if this option is new in CM12, but I think to remember that
I didn't had to enable root access explicitly in previous versions.
