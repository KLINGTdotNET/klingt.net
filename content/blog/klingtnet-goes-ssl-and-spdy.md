Today I stumbled across [HTTPvsHTTPS](https://www.httpvshttps.com/),
which compares both protocols by loading 360 images via each one of them
and telling you the time difference as result. I was really impressed
how fast [SPDY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPDY) was, in comparision
to plain old HTTP, more than 4x faster to give you a number. SPDY
enforces encryption via
[SSL/TLS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) , which
means that you will get *more security* (plus speed) and I am in need
for an SSL certificate.

The certificate
===============

It so happens that there is a coupon for a one year certificate from
[namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) on [github's education
pack](https://education.github.com/pack/), after this period it costs
about 7€ per year, this should be affordable for anyone. To get the
certificate I had to enter a [Certificate Signing
Request](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_signing_request) (CSR)
which I've generated like this:
`openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout example.com.pem -out example.com.csr`.
Because it's not obvious I will explain what every parameter means with
help of `man openssl` and `man req`:

-   `req` use PKCS\#10 X.509 Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
    Management
-   `rsa:2048` generate a 2048-bit key using the RSA algorithm
-   `-keyout example.com.pem` filename for the generated private key
-   `-out example.com.csr` filename for CSR output

The following dialog will ask you for a passphrase to encrypt your
private key, please note the you have to enter it every time your
webserver restarts. If you don't want this, then you have to add the
`-nodes` option. But be warned, this leaves the private.key
*unencrypted*! Depending on your certification authority you have to do
some more steps until you receive the signed certificate. My certificate
was delivered via email, so I had to upload it securely to my server
using `scp` for example. An unencrypted FTP connection is <span
class="strike">not</span> never a good idea <span
class="strike">in this case</span>.

You can specify an `ssl_password_file` in your [nginx
config](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_certificate_key)
if you are lazy.

*Update 2014-12-12:* This needs nginx v.1.7.3 or above!

nginx
=====

Now it's time to edit your site-config that should be located somewhere
like `/etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com`. Because the HTTPS port is
`443` you have to add one or two `listen` directives, dependend on if
you will support IPv6 or not \[1\]\_.

```nginx
listen 443 ssl spdy;
listen [::]:443 ssl spdy;
```

Remember to *open the port in your firewall* or you will look like an
idiot, trust me...

SSL is nothing without certificates, that means you have to add their
location to. Before adding the certificates you may have to take a look
on the instructions of your certification authority, because it can be
necessary to concatenate multiple certificates into one file, e.g.
`cat ROOTCA.key example.com.key > bundle.key`.

```nginx
ssl_certificate /file/path/klingt.net/bundle.crt;
ssl_certificate_key /file/path/server.key;
```

That's all, have fun, feel secure and be SPDY!

Rewrite-Rule
------------

Now that we have SSL enabled we can rewrite all the incoming HTTP
requests to HTTPS, using the following config:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name example.com www.example.com;
    return 301 https://www.example.com$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl spdy;
    listen [::]:443 ssl spdy;

    ssl_certificate /file/path/example.com/bundle.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /file/path/server.key;

    ssl_protocols  TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;   # don’t use SSLv3 because of the POODLE attack

    server_name example.com www.example.com;

    #...
}
```

Updates
-------

-   *2014-12-09* Disabled SSL3 in `nginx.conf` because of the
    vulnerability through the [POODLE
    attack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POODLE) (no, not the [fancy
    haired
    dogs](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Poodle%2C_cropped.JPG)).
    Thanks to Tobias for giving me this advise. You can check your
    settings with [this online-tool](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/).
