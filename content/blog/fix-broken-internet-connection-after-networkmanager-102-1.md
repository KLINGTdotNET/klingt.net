It was a long time since my last post, but I don't want to keep the
following instructions for myself. NetworkManager has
[openresolv](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/core/any/openresolv/) as
an optional dependency and worked without it flawlessly, till today. If
you're lucky then your internet connection will work after the update,
because the old nameserver settings in `/etc/resolv.conf` are be
compatible with the network you are connected to. However, thanks to
[this reddit
post](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/core/any/openresolv/) I was
able to fix the problem.

The first step is to enter a working nameserver in your
`/etc/resolv.conf` by adding the following line `nameserver 8.8.8.8`
(which is the public DNS of google). Bytheway, the file should begin
with `# Generated by NetworkManager`, which changes to
`# Generated by resolvconf` after you finished the instructions.

Now it's time to install `openresolv` by using `pacman -S openresolv` or
whatever package manager you're using. If you don't want to temproarily
use the google DNS server, download the [openresolv
package](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/core/any/openresolv/) on a
computer with working internet connection and install it with:
`pacman -U /path/to/openresolv.xz`. We're almost finished, the last step
is to restart NetworkManager using systemctl:
`systemctl restart NetworkManager`. Voil√†, you have a working internet
connection again!
