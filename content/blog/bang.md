Today I stumbled across this this
[article](https://duckduckgo.com/bang.html) which describes how to use
the so called *!Bangs*. A *!Bang* is nothing more than a shortcut for a
specific websearch prefixed with an `!`.
[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) has hundreds of these shortcuts
integrated, take for example `!i` to search for images with google or
`!yt` to search on YouTube. This is really powerful,
`!wa plot sin(x)*sin(y)` plots a simple wave funtion using
[wolframalpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot%20sin(x)*sin(y)).
You don't have to know all the shortcuts because their autocompletion
does that for you, like you can see in the picture below.

Now I only need to find out how I can request their webcrawler to
recrawl this website, because this was what I actually would have liked
to know.
