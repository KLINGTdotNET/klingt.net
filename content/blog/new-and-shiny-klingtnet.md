Here is the new and shiny [klingt.net](klingt.net)!

This time I'm generating the site with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/overview/quickstart/). It's blazing fast and I don't have to activate some virtual environment and all the other dependency problems that come with script languages and generators like [nikola](https://github.com/getnikola/nikola) (which I previously used).

This blog is available from two new domain, first [theguyfrom.space](https://theguyfrom.space) and second [andreas-linz.de](https://andreas-linz.de).
