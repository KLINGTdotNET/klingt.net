I'm **Andreas Linz**.

I love to develop software, at the moment especially with python_. Besides I enjoy to learn for my masters degree in computer science at the `University Leipzig`_ and write code for spreadshirt_.

Interests
=========

I've a very broad field of interests, with a priority on everything audio related. The whole process from creating music to the physical playback by the loudspeaker always fascinated me. That's why I built my own speakers and sometimes twiddling knobs to make some pleasant sound textures. An arduino_ based midi-controller—that wasn't finished because I never built a case for this thing—was also one of my past projects. Of course I also love listening to music from all kinds of genres.

Of course I am fascinated and interested in computer science topics.

Sometimes, when I have the time and muse, I also draw logos or illustrations, too. Lately this isn't so often the case, because there is also a life w/o technology and I discovered Netflix_.

Technologies
============

- `Arch Linux`_, mainly because I really like the rolling-release model and that you get a vanilla system, unlike all those proprietary modifications that you have on `Ubuntu <http://www.ubuntu.com/>`_ for example
- `zsh`_
- `python`_, only python3 and pypy
- javascript, if you make anything web-related then you won't come around using this mess (waiting for `ecmascript6 <http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:specification_drafts>`_)
- `Java`_, almost never use it for private projects
- C/C++, i have to hone my low-level skills because python in combination with C or C++ is almighty ;)
- `go`_, one of my future goals is to get started with go
- `[Xe]TeX`_ it's a must for academic work and also a hassle, the idea of separating format and content does'nt work at all in any TeX variant if we are honest
- a whole lot of other stuff...

Why klingt.net?
===============

The domain name was an idea of a good friend of mine. The name should have something to do with audio or music, because this was the main topic which I wanted to write about in 2006, when I registered this domain. It's a word play of the german sentence *Das klingt nett*, what means *That sounds nice*.
