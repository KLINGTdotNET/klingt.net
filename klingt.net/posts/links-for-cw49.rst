- A study from 2013 has examinded `the impact of listening to music on cognitive performance <http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/762/the-impact-of-listening-to-music-on-cognitive-performance>`_. They used different musical genres as well as low and high volume levels and there was also a control group that has learned in silence. I've found this study interesting because I am very often listening to background music while programming, learning or reading. According to the results of the study, there is no significant difference between genres but the playback volume is important. The best results achieved the participants that studied in silence, the more the volume increases the more decreases the cognitive performance.
- Because of the unique factorization property of the natural numbers we `can't tune pianos <http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/roots-of-unity/2014/11/30/the-saddest-thing-i-know-about-the-integers/>`_, at least we can't do it perfectly. This article fits very good to the last link from `last weeks list </posts/links-for-cw48>`_.
- A concept for an `HTML6 specifiction <http://html6spec.com/>`_ that introduces namespaces and arbitrary tag names. I would like to see an HTML6 that uses a `HAML <http://haml.info/>`_ like syntax and enforces strictness for parses, invalid HTML should result in an error message.
- The `McDonald's Theory <https://medium.com/@ienjoy/mcdonalds-theory-9216e1c9da7d>`_ [short description].
- Xiph.org's Monty `explains why 24bit/192kHz music downloads are not only useless but also problematic <http://xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/neil-young.html>`_. Before reading this article you should have watched at least his `digital show & tell <http://xiph.org/video/>`_ where he cleans up with common misconceptions about digital audio.
