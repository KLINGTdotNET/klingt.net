- how to understand `python bytecode <http://security.coverity.com/blog/2014/Nov/understanding-python-bytecode.html>`_ using python üêÆ
- why facebook uses `react js to generate their CSS <https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js>`_ and which problem they had with stylesheets at scale:
    1. global namespace
    2. dependencies
    3. dead code elimination
    4. minification
    5. sharing constants
    6. non-deterministic resolution
    7. isolation

    Point 1-5 could be solved using their approach to generate the CSS via JS and I have to admit that `programming` plain CSS is broken. Especially the first 3 points are important, #5 can be solved easily using `SASS <http://sass-lang.com/>`_.

    One thing to note is that even facebook developers are using the crappiest of all web development resources, w3schools.com, like you can see on slide 5.
- a beautiful `collection of vim plugin <http://vimawesome.com/>`_
- `functional progamming using JavaScript <http://scott.sauyet.com/Javascript/Talk/2014/01/FuncProgTalk/#slide-0>`_
- `Hands-On Start to Mathematica <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxn-kpJHbPx1TOYrbMrvqOztwg0Ncv07e>`_ [Videos]
