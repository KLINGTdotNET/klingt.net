.. type: text

To restart your gnome shell you can press ``Alt+F3`` to open the *run command prompt* and type ``r`` restart it.

But what do you do if your gnome-shell got completely stuck? If your computer isn't crashed you should be able to login into one of the `virtual terminals <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator>`_ (tty's). On Arch you can access them via ``Ctrl+Alt+Fx``, where ``x`` is a number between 2 and 6 (at least on my machine). Now you only need to send a ``SIGINT`` signal to your gnome-shell process:

.. code:: sh
    kill -s INT $(pidof gnome-shell)


Now you can logout from your tty and switch back to your gnome-shell with ``Ctrl+Alt+F1``
