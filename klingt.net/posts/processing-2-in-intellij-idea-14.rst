.. description: How to setup a processing 2 project in IntelliJ Idea 14.
.. type: text

Inspired by some live shows of `Grischa Lichtenberger <http://grischa-lichtenberger.com/>`_ that I saw recently and from the `max4live datamatrix <http://www.maxforlive.com/library/device/2665/datamatrix>`_ device, I wanted to do some visual stuff. I had the idea to create a browser based audio visualization app using `d3 <http://d3js.org/>`_ since a few weeks but you can't access the monitor audio stream (which contains the audio that is playedback at the moment) from within the browser. At least all I could access was the microphone stream. This is why I gave processing a second chance. But creating processing sketches using the integrated editor is quite a hassle, so I decided to use `IntelliJ Idea <https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/>`_. Because there is no tutorial out there that describes how to setup a processing environment in Idea, I am ready to change this.

Setup a project
---------------

Create a new Java project without additional libraries and frameworks and choose any name you want, in my case ``processing-example``.

The next thing to do is to import processing ``core`` library. If you haven't installed processing you can get it from the `official website <https://processing.org/download/?processing>`_, `github <https://github.com/processing/processing>`_ or using the package manager of your choice.

Import processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open the project structure dialog ``File → Project Structure ...`` or press ``Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S``, go to ``Libraries`` and add a new Java library using the ``+`` button. If you don't know where processing is installed on your system, use ``locate processing/core`` or ``find / -type d -iname "processing" 2> /dev/null``. Now add the ``core.jar`` file from the ``core/library`` subfolder of you processing installation directory.

Create a new package, e.g. ``net.klingt.example`` and a new Java Class inside that package named ``ProcessingExample``. Now you have to import the processing core library by writing the following import statement: ``import processing.core.*;``. Maybe IntelliJ will remove the line as soon as you press enter, because it assumes that you aren't using anything from it and therefore it *optimizes* the import. To disable this behaviour go to ``File → Settings`` or press ``Ctrl+Alt+S`` and in the following dialog disable ``Optimize imports on the fly`` under ``Editor → General → Auto Import`` [1]_.

Create an example class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your main class has to extend ``PApplet`` and has to implement the ``setup`` and ``draw`` method. It should look something like this:

.. code:: java

    package net.klingt.example;

    import processing.core.*;

    public class ProcessingExample extends PApplet {

        public void setup() {
            size(400,400);
            background(0);
        }

        public void draw() {
            stroke(255);
            if (mousePressed) {
                line(mouseX,mouseY,pmouseX,pmouseY);
            }
        }
    }

This simple applet draws your mouse cursor path when the left mouse button is pressed. I took it from the `eclipse setup instructions <https://processing.org/tutorials/eclipse/>`_ on the processing tutorials.

Before you can run the applet you have to create a run configuration. To do this open ``Run → Make Configurations ... `` and add a new *Applet* configuration with the ``ProcessingExample`` class as *Applet class*.

.. image:: /imgs/processing-idea_run_config.png

Voila, you applet should start when you press the *play* button or ``Shift+F10``!

.. image:: /imgs/processing-idea_applet.png

To run your processing sketch as *Application* instead of an *Applet* you have to implement a ``main`` method. You can add the method to your existing class or create a seperate ``Main`` class like I do.

.. code:: java

    package net.klingt.example;

    import processing.core.PApplet;

    public class Main {
        public static void main(String args[]) {
            // full-screen mode can be activated via parameters to PApplets main method.
            PApplet.main(new String[] {"net.klingt.example.ProcessingExample"});
        }
    }

Now you can run you sketch as *Application* by pressing ``Shift+F10`` in your ``Main`` class.

For further details read the *eclipse setup instructions* that I've linked above or take a look at Daniel Shiffmans `Learning Processing <http://www.learningprocessing.com/>`_ website.

**Update**

You can reuse the project as Idae project template using ``Tools → Save Project as Template ...``.

.. [1] You can optimize the imports manually either by pressing ``Ctrl+Alt+O`` or by using ``Code → Optimize Imports ...``.
