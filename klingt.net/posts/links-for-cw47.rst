.. description: The weekly link list for calendar week 47.: text

- a not-so-basic `introduction into git <http://mrchlblng.me/2014/09/practical-git-introduction/#git-basics>`_
- `neural-networks for hackers <http://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/>`_
- PEP-8 the `python style guide <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008>`_
- `python3 generators <http://simeonvisser.com/posts/python-3-using-yield-from-in-generators-part-1.html>`_ (lazy evaluation) and how to use ``yield from``
- `tinyjpg <https://tinyjpg.com/>`_ compresses .png and .jpgs
    I've used it to compress the images on this website and I haven't noticed any visible differences between the originals and the compressed images.
- `Gray code <http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/november32014/index.html>`_ well explained.
    The difference between the common binary encoding and Gray code is, that between adjacent numbers in gray-code only 1 bit changes state
- A `3D camera flight over a highway in 1023 bytes of Javascript <http://js1k.com/2014-dragons/details/1951>`_, impressive!
- Explanation why in `go the type is declared after the name <http://blog.golang.org/gos-declaration-syntax>`_
- The `clockwise/spiral rule <http://c-faq.com/decl/spiral.anderson.html>`_ that helps deciphering any C declaration
- `youtube-dl <https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/index.html>`_ is a python based platform-independent command-line tool that let's you download videos from a whole lot of video platforms (it's also available in the community repos in Arch)

Videos

- `A winged victory for the sullen <http://boilerroom.tv/recording/a-winged-victory-for-the-sullen/>`_ tomorrow evening live at `UT-Connewitz <http://www.utconnewitz.de/>`_
