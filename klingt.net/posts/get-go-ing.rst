This post is a `pandoc <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>`_ converted version of my `get-go-ing <https://github.com/klingtnet/get-go-ing>`_ github repo. It contains my example solutions and notes to the official `golang tour <https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1>`_.

Get Go'ing
==========

What?
-----

Playground for my `first steps in Go <https://tour.golang.org/list>`__.

`Basics <https://tour.golang.org/basics/1>`__
---------------------------------------------

-  Go programs are made out of **packages**
-  the ``main`` method must be in the **main** package
-  inside of the **import** statement are the packages specified that
   should be imported

   -  the last element of the *import path* is the package name, by
      convention. ``math/rand`` imports the files from ``math`` that
      begin with ``package rand``

-  in Go, a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter, e.g.
   ``math.Pi``

`Functions <https://tour.golang.org/basics/4>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  function definitions start with ``func`` followed by the function
   name, the parameter list and the return value

   -  as opposed to C, the parameter name comes before the type, e.g.
      ``x int``
   -  `here is <https://golang.org/doc/articles/gos_declaration_syntax.html>`__
      why they choosed this syntax
   -  if two or more consecutive parameters share the same type, you can
      omit it from all but the last
   -  a function can return *any* number of values (like tuples in
      python)

-  **strings** are enquoted by doublequotes ``"``

.. code:: go

    func add(a, b int) int {
        return a+b
    }

`Variables & Types <https://tour.golang.org/basics/8>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  the **var** statement declares a list of variables with the type last

   -  it is allowed on *function* and *package* level (global)
   -  examples:

      -  ``var a, b bool``
      -  initalizers can be used like this:

         -  ``var a, b, c = true, false, "hej!"``
         -  note that the type can be omitted if the initializer is
            present
         -  each variable from the initializer list can have a different
            type

   -  var statements can be factored into blocks, similar to the import
      statement, see `basictypes.go <./src/basictypes.go>`__ for an
      example
   -  variables declared without an explicit initial value will be
      instantiated with their specific `zero
      value <https://tour.golang.org/basics/12>`__

-  inside a function the **short assignment** statement can be used:
   ``a := 100``
-  **type conversions** can be done with ``T(..)``, where ``T`` is the
   type and inside of the parantheses is the value to convert, e.g.
   ``float64(128)``

`Function Values <https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/20>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  functions can also be assigned as variable values:

.. code:: go

    square := func(x int) int {
        return x*x
    }

`Closures <https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/21>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  a closure is a function value that references variables from outside
   its body

.. code:: go

    func adder() func(int) int {
        sum := 0
        return func(x int) int {
            sum += x
            return sum
        }
    }

-  the inner function can access the ``sum`` variable from the enclosing
   function, even after the outer function has returned

`Constants <https://tour.golang.org/basics/15>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  declared using the ``const`` keyword
-  **can't** be declared using the short assigment statement ``:=``
-  constants can be character, string boolean or numeric values
-  numeric-constants are `*high-precision*
   values <https://tour.golang.org/basics/16>`__

`Loops <https://tour.golang.org/flowcontrol/1>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  go has only one looping construct, the ``for`` loop
-  to emulate a ``while`` loop leave the *pre* and *post* statements
   empty: ``for ; x < y; {}``, you can even omit the *semicolon*:
   ``for x < y {}``
-  omit the loop conditions and you get an infinite loop: ``for {}``

.. code:: go

    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        sum += i
    }

`Conditions <https://tour.golang.org/flowcontrol/5>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  C-like but without the parentheses:

.. code:: go

    if x < y {
        x++
    } else {
        y++
    }

-  you can write a pre-statement before the if-statement
-  variables declared in this pre-statement are only visible inside the
   scope of the if statement

.. code:: go

    if x := 10; x == 10 {
        fmt.Println("It's only an example.")
    }

-  **switch-case** statements break automatically, unless you specfiy a
   *falltrough* statement (``default`` case)
-  the *evaluation order* is from *top to bottom*
-  a ``switch`` without condition is the same as ``switch true`` and can
   be used for long if-else chains:

.. code:: go

    switch {
    case t.Hour() < 12:
        fmt.Println("Good morning!")
    case t.Hour() < 17:
        fmt.Println("Good afternoon.")
    default:
        fmt.Println("Good evening.")
    }

`Pointers <https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/1>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **pointer declaration** is C-like: ``*T``, where ``T`` is the type of
   a value the pointer refers to
-  **dereferencing** the ``&`` generates an pointer of the value it
   refers to
-  there is no **pointer arithmetic** in Go

.. code:: go

    var p *int
    i := 42
    p = &i
    fmt.Println(*p) // prints 42

-  example use cases:

   -  avoid copying large structs to a function by passing a pointer to
      the struct to the function

      -  as the `Go FAQ <http://golang.org/doc/faq#pass_by_value>`__
         says, it's **not**
         `call-by-reference <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy#Call_by_reference>`__
         because *the pointer is copied*, as well as every other
         argument which is passed to the function

   -  in-place modification, say you want to modify elements of a struct
      inside your function without returning it. I'm sure there is a
      valid use case for this, but I would consider it *bad practice* in
      most cases.

Structured Data
---------------

`Structs <https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/2>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``struct literals`` denotes a newly allocated struct
-  you can list a subset using the ``Name:`` syntax: ``Vertex{X: 3}``
-  the indirection through struct pointers is
   `transparent <https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/4>`__

.. code:: go

    type Vertex struct {
        X int
        Y int
    }

    // instantiation
    v := Vertex{1, 2}
    v.X = 4

`Arrays <https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/6>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  an array of ``n`` elements with type ``T`` is declared like this
   ``[n]T``, e.g. ``[100]rune``
-  arrays **can't** be resized
-  Go has an array slice syntax similar to pythons list slices:

.. code:: go

    p := []int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}
    fmt.Println(p[1:5])

-  ``make([]T, l, c)`` creates a slice with **initial length** ``l`` and
   (optional) **capicity** ``c``
-  ``len(s)`` gives the *length* and ``cap(s)`` the *capacity* of slice
   ``s``
-  a ``nil`` slice (`FP <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cons>`__) has
   length and capacity ``0``
-  a slice can be appended with ``append(s []T, vs ...T) []T``, where
   the first argument is a slice of type ``T`` and the following
   parameters are ``T`` values
-  looping over a slice:

.. code:: go

    x = []int {2, 4, 8}
    for i, v := range x {
        // i = index
        // v = value of x[i]
    }

-  you can skip a loop variable when you assign ``_`` to it, like in
   Python: ``for _, v := range x {}``

`Maps <https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/15>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  map declaration looks like this: ``map[T_key]T_value``, e.g.
   ``map[string]uint64``
-  maps have to be created with ``make(map_declaration)`` before using
   them
-  you can use **map literals** to initalize a map like this:

.. code:: go

    var m2 = map[string]uint64{
        "foo": 42,
        "bar": 314,
    }

-  there **must** be a trailing comma behind the last value!
-  insert ``m[key] = elem``
-  get ``elem = m[key]``
-  ``delete(m, key)``
-  check if a key is present: ``elem, ok = m[key]``, where ``ok`` is
   ``true`` if ``key`` is present in map ``m``, otherwise ``ok`` is
   false and the ``elem`` is the zero value of its type

`Methods <https://tour.golang.org/methods/1>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  there is **no class** construct in Go
-  **but**, you can *define methods on* [struct] *types*, which is
   pratically the same (see `OOP with Ansi-C
   (pdf) <http://www.cs.rit.edu/~ats/books/ooc.pdf>`__) apart from the
   access modifiers
-  the declaration looks like that from a function with an additional
   **Method Receiver** between the ``func`` keyword and the *function
   name*
-  you can call the method like you can access struct elements:
   ``foo.F()``

.. code:: go

    type Vertex struct {
        X, Y float64
    }

    // func MethodReceiver MethodName(Params) ReturnValue
    func (v Vertex) Abs() float64 {
        return math.Sqrt(v.X*v.X + v.Y*v.Y)
    }

-  you can declare method on **any type from your package**, but not on
   others

Methods with `Pointer Receiver <https://tour.golang.org/methods/3>`__
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  two main reasons for using pointer receivers:

   -  **call-by-reference**, as default the method gets a copy of the
      struct (call-by-value)
   -  **modifying** the method receiver **in-place**. You should now why
      you want to do this, because it's the explicit usage of `side
      effects <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_%28computer_science%29>`__

-  you *can't* define the same method name for pointer and value type,
   see the example below

`./src/method\_receiver.go <./src/method_receiver.go>`__

.. code:: go

    type Decimal struct {
        X float64
    }

    func (v Decimal) Double() float64 {
        return 2 * v.X
    }

    func (v *Decimal) DoublePR() {
        v.X = 2 * v.X
    }

    ...
    v := Decimal{3.14}
    // call-by-value
    fmt.Println(v, v.Double())
    // use the pointer Receiver
    v.DoublePR()
    // DoublePR() has mutated v in-place
    fmt.Println(v)

prints out:

::

    {3.14} 6.28
    {6.28}

`Interfaces <https://tour.golang.org/methods/4>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  an **interface type** is defined by a set of methods
-  a **type** implements an interface by **implementing its methods**
-  interfaces are **satisfied implicitly**. There is no explicit
   **implements** keyword (like in Java), therefore an interface is
   satisfied if the type implements its methods.
-  the equivalent of Java's ``toString()`` method is the ``String()``
   method from the ``Stringer`` interface:

.. code:: go

    type Stringer interface {
        String() string
    }

`Errors <https://tour.golang.org/methods/8>`__ (Exceptions in Go)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``errors`` is a built-in interface (similar to ``Stringer``)
-  error checking is done by validating if an error value is ``nil``
   (Go's null type):

.. code:: go

    i, err := strconv.Atoi("42")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("couldn't convert number: %v\n", err)
    }

`Web Servers <https://tour.golang.org/methods/13>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  the `http package <http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/>`__ serves HTTP
   requests using any value that implements ``http.Handler``
-  those values have to implement
   ``ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)``
-  `http Handler <src/exercise-http-handlers.go>`__ example

.. code:: go

    func (s Struct) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        fmt.Fprint(w, fmt.Sprintf("%s%s %s\n", s.Greeting, s.Punct, s.Who))
    }

Concurrency mechanisms
----------------------

`Goroutines <https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  a goroutine is a **lightweight thread**
-  the name is wordplay of
   `coroutines <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine>`__
-  goroutines run in the same address space, so they have access to the
   shared memory → need of synchronization/locks
-  a goroutine is started with ``go f()``, where ``f`` is an arbitrary
   function

   -  f's arguments will be evaluated in the current goroutine
   -  f will be executed in the new goroutine

`Channels <https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/2>`__
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  a channel is a **types pipe** (like pipes from the shell)
-  a channel must be created before use:
   ``ch := make(chan type, bufferlen)``. The ``bufferlen`` parameter is
   optional.
-  you can send and receive values from a channel using the ``<-``
   operator:

   -  send ``ch <- v``
   -  receive ``v := <-ch``

-  send and receive on channels is **blocking** (until the other side is
   ready) by default
-  a buffered channel blocks only when the buffer is full
-  channels **can** be **closed** to indicate that no more values will
   be send
-  **only senders** should close channels!
-  you can check if the second return value of a receive is ``false``,
   then the channel was closed: ``v, ok := <-ch``

Loops until the channel was closed

.. code:: go

    c := make(chan type)
    //...
    for v := range c {
        // ...
    }

-  the ``select`` statement is like ``switch-case`` for channels
-  if mutliple channels are ready at once, a random channel is chosen
-  the ``default`` case is run if no other channel is ready (can be used
   for non-blocking send/receive)

.. code:: go

    select {
    case c <- x:
        x, y = y, x+y
    case <-quit:
        fmt.Println("quit")
        return
    }

Miscellanous
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  the ``defer`` statement defers the execution of a function until the
   surrounding function returns
-  deferred function calls are pushed on a stack and are executed in
   **LIFO** order
-  `more on defer <http://blog.golang.org/defer-panic-and-recover>`__

Tips
----

-  to build & run a Go file in one step use ``go run file.go``
-  Go files can be formatted automatically using the ``gofmt`` tool. On
   default the formatted code is written to ``stdout``, to overwrite the
   source file use ``gofmt -w file.go``.
-  the execution environment of a compiled program is deterministic,
   thus a *random generator* for example has to be seeded, otherwise it
   will deliver the same number on every run of the program

Further Reading
---------------

-  `go-koans <https://github.com/cdarwin/go-koans>`__ lets you learn Go
   by fixing test cases. Sounds boring but instead it's quite fun to fix
   it!
