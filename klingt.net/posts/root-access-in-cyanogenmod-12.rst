I've wondered why `SuperSU <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.supersu&hl=de>`_ wasn't working after I've `upgraded my phone to CM12 </posts/installing-cyanogenmod-12-android-l-on-htc-one-s-ville/>`_ yesterday. To enable root access you have to activate the *Developer Menu* by touching 7 times on the *Build Number* in *Settings â†’ About Phone/Tablet*. Now you can enable it only for Apps, the Android Debug Bridge or both in the developer menu.

I' not sure if this option is new in CM12, but I think to remember that I didn't had to enable root access explicitly in previous versions.
