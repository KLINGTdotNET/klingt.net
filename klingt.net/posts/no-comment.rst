.. description: Why I don't want to provide a comment box for this blog.
.. type: text


No, I won't provide a comment box. This has several reasons. At first I won't spend my time moderating the comment system and dealing with spam. Letting users comment without much effort encourages some of them to overreact without reflecting their own opinions. At last I don't like the idea to use external comment systems like disqus f.e., because it feels slow on mobile and as an external service it is out of my control. That's bad because I care about the privacy of my readers.

This shouldn't prevent you from sending me your questions and criticism, because I would like to read them. To do this you have to make a little bit of effort and write me a mail. If you want to see your comment published, please add a this to your mail. But keep in mind that I reserve the right to decide what to publish, this should'nt be a problem if your message conforms to the basic rules of courtesy.
