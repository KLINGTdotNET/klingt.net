To restart your gnome shell you can press `Alt+F3` to open the *run
command prompt* and type `r` restart it.

But what do you do if your gnome-shell got completely stuck? If your
computer isn't crashed you should be able to login into one of the
[virtual terminals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator)
(tty's). On Arch you can access them via `Ctrl+Alt+Fx`, where `x` is a
number between 2 and 6 (at least on my machine). Send a `SIGINT` signal
to your gnome-shell process:

``` {.sourceCode .sh}
kill -s INT $(pidof gnome-shell)
```

Logout from your tty and switch back to your gnome-shell with
`Ctrl+Alt+F1`. Done.
