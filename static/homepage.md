# Hi!

I'm **Andreas Linz** and I love technology.

I've learned how to solder and measure electronic components, layout schematics, build circuit boards, even how to operate a lathe or CNC mill. But my real passion are computers. Therefore I decided to study computer science, got my bachelors degree in 2013 and I'm currently in the last steps of finishing my masters degree at the [University of Leipzig](http://www.uni-leipzig.de/). 
My masters thesis topic is *Programming a Realtime Remote Controllable FM Audio Synthesizer in Rust*.

As you maybe already guessed, I'm also passionate about audio. I've build loudspeakers, a Midi controller and I'm maintaining some audio related software projects ([rsoundio](https://github.com/klingtnet/rsoundio) ,[rosc](https://github.com/klingtnet/rosc), ...).

I love music and I'm fascinated by the whole process of generating audio signals. Besides, I like to do systems programming and build web services. I also have some experience with front-end technologies like CSS/SCSS or Javascript. Sometimes I create beautiful things with [TeX](https://github.com/klingtnet/beamer_template), too.
